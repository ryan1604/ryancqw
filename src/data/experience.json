        "Developed an optical-to-SAR image translation model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), self-attention, and semantic labels to generate realistic SAR images and address optical bias in previous models.",
        "Accomplished improved model performance as measured by quantitative (PSNR, SSIM, FID) and qualitative evaluations by incorporating self-attention and semantic labels into the GAN architecture.",
        "Conducted extensive research on various deep learning techniques, including GAN architectures (pix2pix, cycleGAN), self-attention mechanisms, and image segmentation methods, to inform model development and optimization."
